                    <h2>Our Story: From Challenge to Calling</h2>
                    <p>
                        <strong>JSTechnoHub</strong> was born not from a business plan, but from a personal breakthrough. Our founder, Alex Dawson, spent years navigating the high-pressure corporate world, feeling stuck and unfulfilled. It was through a journey of self-discovery and mentorship that Alex realized true success isn't about climbing a ladder, but about building a life aligned with one's authentic purpose.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This transformation sparked a calling: to provide others with the tools, support, and accountability needed to make their own pivotal shifts. We don't just teach theory; we coach from a place of deep, personal experience.
